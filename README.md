# hello-world

My name is Mimi and I am an aspiring developer from the Pacific NorthWest. In December 2020, my husband and I made the decision to learn coding and started #100DaysofCode! I am beginning with Free Code Camp. I will also be learning through The Odin Project. I have future plans to take Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy courses of The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021.

I am excited to use resources to track my journey. Follow me on Twitter @rosegoldpish and here on GitHub for the latest projects I am working on.
